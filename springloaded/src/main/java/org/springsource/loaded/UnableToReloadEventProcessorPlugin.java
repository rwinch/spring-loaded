	 * Called when a type cannot be reloaded, due to a change being made that is not supported by the agent, for example when the
	 * set of interfaces for a type is changed. Note, the class is only truly defined to the VM once, and so the Class object (clazz
	 * parameter) is always the same for the same type (ignoring multiple classloader situations). It is passed here so that plugins
	 * processing events can clear any cached state related to it. The encodedTimestamp is an encoding of the ID that the agent has
	 * assigned to this reloaded version of this type. The TypeDelta (a work in progress) captures details about what changed in the
	 * type that could not be reloaded.
	 * 
	 * @param typename the (dotted) type name, for example java.lang.String
	 * @param clazz the Class object that has been reloaded
	 * @param typeDelta encapsulates information about the changes made in this version of the type that prevented the reload
	 * @param encodedTimestamp an encoded time stamp for this version, containing chars (A-Za-z0-9)
